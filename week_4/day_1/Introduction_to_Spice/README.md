# Introduction to SPICE:
    
1. Basic SPICE setup-
    The spice requires model parameters and netlist.
    The image below shows the spice setup in better sense.

2. Circuit description in SPICE syntax-
    The spice netlist along with the syntax is shown below.

3. Define technology parameters-
    The technology parameter and the syntax to add it in the description is shown below.

4. First SPICE simulation
    The simulation of nmos (tt) following the steps shown in video, the obtained plot for drained current v/s drained voltage along with the terminal is shown below.
