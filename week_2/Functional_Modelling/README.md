# Functional_Modelling

Practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave). 

### Part 2 â€“ Labs (Hands-on Functional Modelling) 

After following the instructions provided in the PDF (cloning, compiling, simulate and generate .vcd waveform files), the obtained `pre_synth_sim.vcd` file is attached. The simulated waveform is also attached.

### Signals in the Simulation

- **CLK**:
  - Input clock signal of the `RVMYTH` core.
  - Originally comes from the PLL.

- **reset**:
  - Input reset signal of the `RVMYTH` core.
  - Originally comes from an external source.

- **RV_TO_DAC[9:0]**:
  - 10-bit output port `[9:0]` of the `RVMYTH` core.
  - Derived from `RVMYTH` register #17.

- **OUT (real datatype)**:
  - Output wire of type `real` from the DAC module.
  - Can simulate analog values.
  - Originally comes from the DAC.

- **OUT**:
  - Output signal of the `VSDBabySoC` module.
  - Comes from the DAC.
  - Due to simulation restrictions, it behaves like a digital signal (not the correct analog behavior).

In the image shown above, the signals are the same. The only difference is the OUT in the last, which is the output of the `VSDBabySoC` but it is shown as an analog step wave.
